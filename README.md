CloudBot is a simple, fast, expandable open-source Python IRC Bot!

## Getting CloudBot

There are currently four different branches of this repository, each with a different level of stability:
 - **gonzobot** *(stable)*: This branch contains everything in the **master** branch plus additional plugins added for Snoonet IRC. This branch is the currently maintained branch which will also contain many fixes for various bugs from the master branch.
 - **gonzobot-dev** *(unstable)*: This branch is based off of the **gonzobot** branch and includes new plugins that are not fully tested.
 - **master** *(stable (old))*: This branch contains stable, tested code. This branch is based directly on the upstream master branch and is not currently maintained.
 - **python3.4** *(unstable (old))*: This is the outdated testing branch from the upstream repo.

## Installing CloudBot

Firstly, CloudBot will only run on **Python 3.5.3 or higher**

To install CloudBot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](docs/installing/nix.md)

To install CloudBot on Windows, see [here](docs/installing/win.md)


### Running CloudBot

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

```
python3 -m cloudbot
```

Note that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3 CloudBot/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
Specify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.
